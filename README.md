# Angular-game---Assignment-4
This game outputs every second an incrementing number. Depending if the number is even or odd we output it in different color. Here I just learned how to make a component listenable from the outside. It's an assignment from the course from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy. Angular - The complete guide. Master Angular 13 (formerly "Angular 2") and build awesome, reactive web apps with the successor of Angular.js.
